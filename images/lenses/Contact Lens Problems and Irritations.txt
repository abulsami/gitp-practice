Contact Lens Problems and Irritations
Common irritation comes along with wearing contact lenses, but how do you know if this irritation is something more serious? There are four common eye irritations that can be caused by wearing contact lenses, including:

Red, itchy eyes – Contact lenses need to be properly taken care of with regular cleaning and removal in order to prevent a bacterial infection. Contact lenses can easily trap secondhand cigarette smoke, pollen, dust, smog and makeup. The buildup of these irritants can cause itchy, red or burning eyes and lead to pink eye (conjunctivitis).
Dry eyes – Soft contact lenses all contain a varying amount of water, and the more water a lens has, the more easily it loses that water. When the lens evaporates water, it will react by pulling moisture from the eye, which causes the eye to become dry. Although dry eyes is a fairly common condition, those who suffer from it on a constant basis could have dry eye syndrome. This condition is caused by low production of natural tears or too much water evaporation of the watery tear layer. Age, change in hormones or an autoimmune disease is all possible causes for low tear production.
Sensitivity to light – Wearing contacts too long can lead to corneal ulcers and corneal abrasions that scar the cornea and make the eye sensitive to light. Along with wearing contacts for too long, dirt, metal particles, sand and certain medicines are all possible causes of corneal abrasions.
Blurry or cloudy vision – When wearing dirty or damaged contact lenses, vision may become blurred or cloudy. In more serious cases, glaucoma, macular degeneration or cataracts could be the reason behind blurred vision, which is why it is important to see your eye doctor immediately if you begin to experience changes in your vision.
