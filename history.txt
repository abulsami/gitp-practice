In 1929, US Army Air Corps Colonel John A. Macready worked with Bausch & Lomb, a Rochester,<br> New York-based medical equipment manufacturer, to create aviation sunglasses that would reduce the distraction for pilots caused by<br> the intense blue and white hues of the sky.<br> Specifically, MacCready was concerned about how pilots' goggles would fog up, greatly reducing visibility at high altitude.<br> The prototype, created in 1936 and known as ‘Anti-Glare’, had plastic frames and green lenses that could cut out the glare without obscuring vision.<br> They also added impact-resistant lenses in 1938. The sunglasses were redesigned with a metal frame the following year<br> and patented as the Ray-Ban Aviator. According to the BBC, the glasses used “Kalichrome lenses designed to sharpen details and minimise haze by<br> filtering out blue light, making them ideal for misty conditions.”

<br>In 1999, the Global Eyewear Division of Bausch & Lomb,<br> including Ray-Ban was acquired by Luxottica Group for US$640 million.
